SOCIAL MEDIA AGGREGATOR
-----------------------

Init: 		December 16, 2014

Problem: 	How can I keep track of all my online social activities?
		How can I keep track of my professional network?
		How can I keep track of my personal network?

Solution:	Need a social media aggregator

5-min survey:	Attempts have been made but none have been very successful.

Musings:	Needs to be secure
		Needs to be interactive (ie., contribute to social network from directly 		within aggregator)	
		A visual network map would be nice
		Reminders to contact, birthday reminders, etc.

Next Steps:	Need to understand the space, what has been attempted, why hasn't been 	
		successful

Goal: 		A social media aggregator - as popular are Facebook
		Privacy built-in
		Functions as powerfully as each individual outlet
		Visualize your aggregated network & sort
		Reminders
